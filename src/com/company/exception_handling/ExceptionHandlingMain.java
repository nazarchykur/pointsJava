    Difference between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions
    
        1) Checked Exception
        The classes that directly inherit the Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked 
        exceptions. For example, IOException, SQLException, etc. Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.
        
        2) Unchecked Exception
        The classes that inherit the RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions. 
        For example, ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, etc. 
        Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time, but they are checked at runtime.
        
        3) Error
        Error is irrecoverable. Some example of errors are OutOfMemoryError, VirtualMachineError, AssertionError etc.

Here's the syntax of try...catch block:

        try {
          // code that may raise exception  
        } catch(Exception e) {
          // code
        }

        | try {                              |  try {                                |
        |   // code that may raise exception |    //code that may throw an exception |
        | } catch (ExceptionType1 e1) {      |  } finally {                          |

Java Multi-catch block
    A try block can be followed by one or more catch blocks. Each catch block must contain a different exception handler. 
    So, if you have to perform different tasks at the occurrence of different exceptions, use java multi-catch block.

Points to remember
    > At a time only one exception occurs and at a time only one catch block is executed.
    > All catch blocks must be ordered from most specific to most general, i.e. catch for ArithmeticException must come 
        before catch for Exception.
            
Let's see a simple example of java multi-catch block.

        try {    
            int a[]=new int[5];    
            a[5]=30/0;    
        } catch(ArithmeticException e) {  
            System.out.println("Arithmetic Exception occurs");  
        } catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {  
            System.out.println("ArrayIndexOutOfBounds Exception occurs");  
        } catch(Exception e) {  
            System.out.println("Parent Exception occurs");  
        }        
             
           System.out.println("rest of the code");    
        }

Checked Exceptions

    The checked exception is an exception that is checked by the compiler during the compilation process to confirm 
    whether the exception is handled by the programmer or not. If it is not handled, the compiler displays a 
    compilation error using built-in classes.
    
    The checked exceptions are generally caused by faults outside of the code itself like missing resources, 
    networking errors, and problems with threads come to mind.
    
    The following are a few built-in classes used to handle checked exceptions in java.
        > IOException
        > FileNotFoundException
        > ClassNotFoundException
        > SQLException
        > DataAccessException
        > InstantiationException
        > UnknownHostException

    ðŸ”” In the exception class hierarchy, the checked exception classes are the direct children of the Exception class.
    
    The checked exception is also known as a compile-time exception.
 */

/*

If ClassNotFoundException or FileNotFoundException are thrown (occur) in a method, the developer must indicate them in 
the method declaration. These are checked exceptions. 
    
    This is how it usually looks:

        public static void method1() throws ClassNotFoundException, FileNotFoundException
        public static void main() throws IOException
        public static void main() // Doesn't throw any exceptions

        
        For the program to compile, the method that calls method1 in the example below must do one of two things: 
            > either catch these exceptions or rethrow them (to the caller), 
            > indicating the rethrown exceptions in its declaration.
        
        
        Again. If your main method needs to call a method whose declaration contains 'throws FileNotFoundException, â€¦', 
        then you need to do one of two things:
            1) Catch FileNotFoundException, â€¦
                You must wrap the code calling the unsafe method in a try-catch block.
            
            2) Don't catch FileNotFoundException, â€¦
                You must add these exceptions to the throws list of your main method.

            
            Examples of checked exceptions
                    public static void main(String[] args) {
                        method1();
                    }
                    
                    public static void method1() throws FileNotFoundException, ClassNotFoundException {
                        //Throws FileNotFoundException if the file doesn't exist
                        FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("C2:\badFileName.txt");
                    }
                    
            The code in this example won't compile, because the main method calls method1(), 
            which throws exceptions that have to be caught.
            
            
            To make it compile, we need to add exception handling to the main method. 
            You can do this in one of two ways:
            
                Option 1: We simply rethrow the exception (to the caller):
                    
                        public static void main(String[] args)  throws FileNotFoundException, ClassNotFoundException {
                            method1();
                        }
                        
                        public static void method1() throws FileNotFoundException, ClassNotFoundException {
                            //Throws FileNotFoundException if the file doesn't exist
                            FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("C2:\badFileName.txt");
                        }
                        
                        
                And here we catch it with a try-catch:
                Option 2: Catch the exception:
                
                        public static void main(String[] args) {
                            try {
                                method1();
                            } catch(Exception e) {
                            }
                        }
                        
                        public static void method1() throws FileNotFoundException, ClassNotFoundException {
                            //Throws FileNotFoundException if the file doesn't exist
                            FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("C2:\badFileName.txt");
                        }   
           
      
      There is one more type of exception, the RuntimeException and classes that inherit it. 
      You don't need to catch them. These are unchecked exceptions. 
      They are considered difficult to predict. 
      You can deal with them in the same way, but you don't need to indicate them in a throws clause.

Java try-with-resources
    The try-with-resources statement automatically closes all the resources at the end of the statement. 
    A resource is an object to be closed at the end of the program.
    
    Its syntax is:
            try (resource declaration) {
              // use of the resource
            } catch (ExceptionType e1) {
              // catch block
            }

            
Advantages of using try-with-resources:

        1. finally block not required to close the resource
            Before Java 7 introduced this feature, we had to use the finally block to ensure that the resource 
            is closed to avoid resource leaks.

            Notice the try...catch block in the finally block as well? This is because an IOException can also occur 
            while closing the BufferedReader instance inside this finally block so it is also caught and handled.
            
            The try-with-resources statement does automatic resource management. We need not explicitly close the 
            resources as JVM automatically closes them. This makes the code more readable and easier to write.

/*
Java 9 try-with-resources enhancement

    In Java 7, there is a restriction to the try-with-resources statement. 
    The resource needs to be declared locally within its block.
            try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File("testRead.txt"))) {
              // code
            }

              // code

    To deal with this error, Java 9 improved the try-with-resources statement so that the reference of the resource 
    can be used even if it is not declared locally. The above code will now execute without any compilation error.

    An exception is first thrown from the top of the stack and if it is not caught, it drops down the call stack to 
    the previous method. If not caught there, the exception again drops down to the previous method, and so on 
    until they are caught or until they reach the very bottom of the call stack. This is called exception propagation.

Java throw Exception
    
    In Java, exceptions allows us to write good quality codes where the errors are checked at the compile time 
    instead of runtime and we can create custom exceptions making the code recovery and debugging easier.
    
    
Java throw keyword

    The Java throw keyword is used to throw an exception explicitly.

    We specify the exception object which is to be thrown. The Exception has some message with it that provides 
    the error description. These exceptions may be related to user inputs, server, etc.
    
    We can throw either checked or unchecked exceptions in Java by throw keyword. 
    It is mainly used to throw a custom exception.
     
    
    
    We can also define our own set of conditions and throw an exception explicitly using throw keyword. 
    For example, we can throw ArithmeticException if we divide a number by another number. 
    Here, we just need to set the condition and throw exception using throw keyword.
    
         > throw new exception_class("error message");  
         > throw new IOException("sorry device error");   
         
         
 */

/*
    Example 1: Throwing Unchecked Exception
    In this example, we have created a method named validate() that accepts an integer as a parameter. 
    If the age is less than 18, we are throwing the ArithmeticException otherwise print a message welcome to vote.

 */
class _6_1_TestThrow1 {
    //function to check if person is eligible to vote or not   
    public static void validate(int age) {
        if (age < 18) {
            //throw Arithmetic exception if not eligible to vote  
            throw new ArithmeticException("Person is not eligible to vote");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Person is eligible to vote!!");

        System.out.println("rest of the code..."); // not printed
    }
} 

/*
Example 2: Throwing Checked Exception

Note: Every subclass of Error and RuntimeException is an unchecked exception in Java. 
    A checked exception is everything else under the Throwable class.

    //function to check if person is eligible to vote or not

/*
The above code throw an unchecked exception. Similarly, we can also throw unchecked and user defined exceptions.

Note: If we throw unchecked exception from a method, it is must to handle the exception or declare in throws clause.

/*
Java throws keyword

    The Java throws keyword is used to declare an exception. It gives an information to the programmer that there may 
    occur an exception. So, it is better for the programmer to provide the exception handling code so that the normal 
    flow of the program can be maintained.
    
    Exception Handling is mainly used to handle the checked exceptions. If there occurs any unchecked exception such 
    as NullPointerException, it is programmers' fault that he is not checking the code before it being used.
    
    Syntax of Java throws:
            return_type method_name() throws exception_class_name{  
                //method code  
            } 
    
    Which exception should be declared?
        Answer: Checked exception only, because:
            > unchecked exception: under our control so we can correct our code.
            > error: beyond our control. For example, we are unable to do anything if there occurs VirtualMachineError or StackOverflowError.
            
            
    Advantage of Java throws keyword
        Now Checked Exception can be propagated (forwarded in call stack). 
        It provides information to the caller of the method about the exception.

Difference between final, finally and finalize

    The final, finally, and finalize are keywords in Java that are used in exception handling. 
    Each of these keywords has a different functionality. 
    The basic difference between final, finally and finalize is that the final is an access modifier, 
    finally is the block in Exception Handling and finalize is the method of object class.

Exception Handling with Method Overriding in Java
    
    There are many rules if we talk about method overriding with exception handling.

    Some of the rules are listed below:
        > If the superclass method does not declare an exception, subclass overridden method cannot declare the checked 
            exception but it can declare unchecked exception.
        
        > If the superclass method declares an exception, subclass overridden method can declare same, 
            subclass exception or no exception but cannot declare parent exception.

/*
    Reasons for Exception Occurrence
    
    Several reasons lead to the occurrence of an exception. A few of them are as follows.
        > When we try to open a file that does not exist may lead to an exception.
        > When the user enters invalid input data, it may lead to an exception.
        > When a network connection has lost during the program execution may lead to an exception.
        > When we try to access the memory beyond the allocated range may lead to an exception.
        > The physical device problems may also lead to an exception.
    
    Types of Exception:
        > Checked Exception - An exception that is checked by the compiler at the time of compilation is called a checked exception.
        > Unchecked Exception - An exception that can not be caught by the compiler but occurrs at the time of program 
            execution is called an unchecked exception.


    How exceptions handled in Java?
    
         In java, the exception handling mechanism uses five keywords namely try, catch, finally, throw, and throws.
